            | For some time software development seemed beyond my reach but through the Techdegree program at Treehouse,
            | I've been able to use what I'd studied at Hack Oregon and practiced in Treehouse workspaces to create real projects of my own.
            | Now I feel confident I could contribute to a development team while reinventing myself.
            | One of my goals is to help other women and girls learn to code with confidence.
